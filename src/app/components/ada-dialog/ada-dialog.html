      We welcome feedback regarding any accessibility barriers encountered on

    <h4>Client and Third-Party Content</h4>

    <p>
      While LocalContactForms maintains accessibility features within its core
      platform, some form content, configurations, or embedded media may be created or
      controlled by <strong>{{ data.clientName || 'our client' }}</strong> or other
      third parties. Such content may not fully adhere to accessibility standards.
    </p>

    <p>
      We encourage Clients to review and maintain accessibility for their own form
      fields, messages, uploaded content, or linked materials.
